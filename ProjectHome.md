# What is the Spreadsheet Data Connector? #

This project contains an abstract layer on top of the [Apache POI library](http://poi.apache.org/). This abstraction layer provides the [Spreadsheet Query Language â€“ eXql](http://code.google.com/p/spreadsheet-data-connector/wiki/QueryLanguage) and additional method to access a spreadsheet.

The current version is designed to support the XLS and XLSX format of Microsoft(C) Excel(R) files.

## When to use the Spreadsheet Data Connector ##

The Spreadsheet Data Connector is well suited for all use cases where you have to access data in Excel sheets **and** you need a sophisticated language to address and query the data.

## Applications of the Spreadsheet Data Connector ##

Currently the Spreadsheet Data Connector is used in the social topic maps explorer [Maiana](http://maiana.topicmapslab.de). In example the information [for the topic places](http://maiana.topicmapslab.de/u/cebit/tm/koordinaten-aus-excel/t/si%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fdbpedia.org%2Fontology%2FPlace) are extracted in runtime from an Excel(R) sheet by using the Data Connector.

Please drop us a note when you use the Spreadsheet Data Connector in other projects. We will add it to our list.
